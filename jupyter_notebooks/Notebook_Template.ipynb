        "**Fetch Data from Kaggle and Save as Raw Data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Download the retail sales dataset from Kaggle and store it in a raw format for initial analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Initial Data Exploration and Cleaning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and quality of the data, and perform initial cleaning tasks such as handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Data Transformation and Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Transform the raw data into a suitable format for analysis, create new features (e.g., sales differences between holiday and non-holiday weeks), and standardize data formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Descriptive Statistics and Visualization:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Generate descriptive statistics and create visualizations to summarize the data and identify initial trends and patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Formulate and validate hypotheses using statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to uncover insights from the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Predictive Modeling and Forecasting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Build predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data and identified trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact Analysis of Promotional Markdowns:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose: Analyze the impact of promotional markdowns on sales during holiday and non-holiday periods, and visualize the results.\n",
